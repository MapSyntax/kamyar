    "I teach GIS, spatial analysis, and computational methods at the University of Helsinki. My teaching focuses on open science, reproducible spatial workflows, and learning by doing with real-world data. Many of my courses are fully open and used internationally as self-study resources and MOOCs. In most of my teachings I use open source solutions and Python programming. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **[Geo-Python](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/)** — Introduction to Python for geospatial analysis (2023–), University of Helsinki  \n",
    "  An introductory course on Python programming with a focus on spatial data analysis. Topics include core Python concepts, geospatial data structures, data processing, and reproducible analysis workflows using open-source libraries. The course is offered as an open MOOC and is widely used beyond the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Automating GIS Processes](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io/)** — Advanced spatial analysis and GIS automation (2023–), University of Helsinki  \n",
    "  A continuation course focusing on automating GIS workflows using Python and open-source GIS tools. Students learn advanced spatial analysis, batch processing, and how to build efficient, reproducible geospatial pipelines. All course materials are openly available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Cartographic Visualization in GIS](https://cartogis.readthedocs.io/)** — Cartography and geovisualization (2024–), University of Helsinki  \n",
    "  This course introduces principles of cartographic design and visual communication of spatial information. It combines cartographic theory with hands-on exercises in digital mapping and geovisualization using open-source tools. The course materials are openly accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Urban GIS** — Applied GIS for urban environments (2025–), University of Helsinki/Aalto University (Urban Studies Program)  \n",
    "  A project-based course focusing on GIS applications in urban contexts. Students work with real urban datasets and address questions related to mobility, land use, accessibility, and environmental exposure using spatial analysis and visualization methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Urban analytics and Spatial statitics** — Advanced GIS for urban environments (2027–), University of Helsinki  \n",
    "  This is a MOOC and currently in the making. \n"
