Kamyar H personal website
=========================

Welcome
-------

Hi, I’m Kamyar Hasanzadeh, a geospatial researcher, problem solver, and educator based in Finland at the University of Helsinki, Department of Geosciences and Geography.

My work sits at the intersection of:
- human mobility and everyday travel behavior
- active travel and greener, more sustainable travel choices
- person–environment relationships and environmental exposure
- participatory mapping (PPGIS / SoftGIS), VGI, and citizen-generated data
- GIS methods and open-source, reproducible workflows in Python (Geospatial research software engineering)
- emerging AI support for geospatial science

This website is a simple hub for my research, publications, teaching, and academic CV.

Open education and teaching
---------------------------

I teach GIS and Python using open course materials and interactive methods, with an emphasis on hands-on learning and reproducible methods. I also develop open educational content and course environments that students can run locally or in containerized setups.
